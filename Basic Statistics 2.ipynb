    "# Estimating the Mean Durability of Print-Heads\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "In quality control processes, especially when dealing with high-value items, destructive sampling is a necessary but costly method to ensure product quality. The manufacturer of print-heads for personal computers is interested in estimating the mean durability of their print-heads in terms of the number of characters printed before failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "A total of 15 print-heads were randomly selected and tested until failure. The durability (in millions of characters) of each print-head was recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Tasks\n",
    "- **a.** Build a 99% confidence interval using the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "- **b.** Build a 99% confidence interval using the known population standard deviation (if known).\n",
    "## a. 99% Confidence Interval Using Sample Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the small sample size (n = 15), and assuming that the sample is representative of the population, we will use the t-distribution to construct the confidence interval.\n",
    "## b. 99% Confidence Interval Using Known Population Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "If the population standard deviation is known to be 0.2 million characters, we use the z-distribution to construct the confidence interval.\n",
    "## Summary of Results\n",
    "- **99% Confidence Interval using Sample Standard Deviation:** (1.09, 1.39) million characters.\n",
    "- **99% Confidence Interval using Known Population Standard Deviation:** (1.11, 1.37) million characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval is slightly narrower when using the known population standard deviation, indicating reduced uncertainty when population parameters are known.\n"
