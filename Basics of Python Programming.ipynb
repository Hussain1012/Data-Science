    "# Basic Statistics Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains solutions to five Python exercises designed to practice basic programming skills. Each exercise is described in a markdown cell, followed by the corresponding Python code in a code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Prime Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Product of Random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a Python program that generates two random numbers and asks the user to enter the product of these numbers. The program should then check if the user's answer is correct and display an appropriate message.\n",
    "## Exercise 3: Squares of Even/Odd Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Python script that prints the squares of all even or odd numbers within the range of 100 to 200. Choose either even or odd numbers and document your choice in the code.\n",
    "## Exercise 4: Word Counter\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to count the number of words in a given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- Input text: `\"This is a sample text. This text will be used to demonstrate the word counter.\"`\n",
    "- Expected Output:\n",
    "  - `'This': 2` \n",
    "  - `'is': 1`\n",
    "  - `'a': 1`\n",
    "  - `'sample': 1`\n",
    "  - `'text.': 1`\n",
    "## Exercise 5: Check for Palindrome\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function called `is_palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- Input: `\"racecar\"`\n",
    "- Expected Output: `True`\n"
