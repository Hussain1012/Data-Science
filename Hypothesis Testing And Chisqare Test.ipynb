    "# Hypothesis Testing for Bombay Hospitality Ltd.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Bombay Hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "W = 1000 + 5X\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where \\( X \\) represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Provided\n",
    "- **Theoretical weekly operating cost model:** \\( W = 1000 + 5X \\)\n",
    "- **Sample of 25 restaurants** with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3050\n",
    "- **Number of units produced in a week (X)** follows a normal distribution with a mean (\\( \\mu \\)) of 600 units and a standard deviation (\\( \\sigma \\)) of 25 units\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. State the Hypotheses Statement\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The mean weekly operating cost is equal to the theoretical mean weekly cost based on the cost model.\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  H_0: \\mu = 1000 + 5 \\cdot 600 = 4000\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The mean weekly operating cost is higher than the theoretical mean weekly cost.\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  H_1: \\mu > 4000\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Calculate the Test Statistic\n",
    "We will calculate the test statistic (t) using the formula:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{x} = 3050 \\) (sample mean weekly cost)\n",
    "- \\( \\mu = 4000 \\) (theoretical mean weekly cost)\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma = 5 \\cdot 25 = 125 \\) (standard deviation of the weekly cost based on units produced)\n",
    "- \\( n = 25 \\) (sample size)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Determine the Critical Value\n",
    "For a one-tailed test at a significance level of 5% (\\( \\alpha = 0.05 \\)), the critical value from the standard normal (Z) distribution table is approximately 1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Make a Decision\n",
    "Compare the calculated test statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Conclusion\n",
    "Based on the comparison, conclude whether there is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests.\n",
